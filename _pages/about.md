My name is Qian Chu (褚乾) and I am a PhD candidate at the [Max Planck-University of Toronto Centre for Neural Science and Technology (MPUTC)](https://mpc.utoronto.ca). Before starting my PhD, I obtained my BS in Neural Science from [New York University Shanghai](https://bcs.shanghai.nyu.edu) under the supervision of [Xing Tian](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/xing-tian).

My research lies at the intersection of **perception**, **action**, and **cognition**, aiming to understand how the brain constructs holistic experiences of the world. I study the cognitive and neural representations underlying human episodic memory and spatial navigation through naturalistic behavioral paradigms, eye-tracking, and intracranial electrophysiology. I am fortunate work under the guidance of [Taufik Valiante](https://surgery.utoronto.ca/faculty/taufik-valiante), [Lucia Melloni](https://www.uaruhr.de/en/detail/lucia-melloni-2769/), and [José Zariffa](https://bme.utoronto.ca/faculty-research/core-faculty/jose-zariffa/)  as part of the MPUTC joint PhD program.

Beyond my own research, I enjoy developing and contributing to open-source scientific software, including [PyNeon](https://github.com/ncc-brain/pyneon), [MultiSim](https://github.com/AlexLepauvre/multisim-neuro), and [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html).
