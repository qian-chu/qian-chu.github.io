I am a PhD candidate at the [Max Planck-University of Toronto Centre for Neural Science and Technology](https://mpc.utoronto.ca), conducting research at the intersection of **perception**, **action**, and **cognition** to understand how the brain constructs our experience of the world.

I am fortunate to be supervised by a team of excellent scientists with complementary expertise, including [Taufik Valiante](https://surgery.utoronto.ca/faculty/taufik-valiante), [Lucia Melloni](https://www.uaruhr.de/en/detail/lucia-melloni-2769/), and [José Zariffa](https://bme.utoronto.ca/faculty-research/core-faculty/jose-zariffa/).

Beyond my own research, I enjoy contributing to open-source scientific software such as [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html).
